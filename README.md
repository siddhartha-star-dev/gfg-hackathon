# Medical Website
## Abstract
A medical platform that allows doctors and patients to store and access medical records.

## Problem
Patients often struggle to remember the details of their past health problems, diagnoses, and treatments when visiting a doctor.

## Solution
Our web application features a database system that doctors can use to enter details of a patient's diagnosis and medicines. The platform stores all the previous records of the patient and allows patients to upload images of their medical files. Additionally, it includes a prescription form where doctors can generate prescriptions.
