Medical Website
Abstract
A medical platform that allows doctors and patients to store and access medical records.

Problem
Patients often struggle to remember the details of their past health problems, diagnoses, and treatments when visiting a doctor.

Solution
Our web application features a database system that doctors can use to enter details of a patient's diagnosis and medicines. The platform stores all the previous records of the patient and allows patients to upload images of their medical files. Additionally, it includes a prescription form where doctors can generate prescriptions.
