## Problem

When visiting a doctor, patients may feel nervous or anxious, which can make it difficult for them to recall important details about their health history. Additionally, some patients may have multiple health conditions, which can make it challenging to remember all of the details of each diagnosis and treatment. Language barriers or cognitive impairments can also contribute to difficulty in communication between patients and doctors. In some cases, patients may not even be aware of all the health issues they have had in the past, especially if they have not been diagnosed or treated previously. All of these factors can make it challenging for patients to provide accurate and comprehensive information to their healthcare provider, which can potentially impact the quality of care they receive.


## Solution

1. Our web application features a database system for doctors to enter patient information and generate prescriptions.
2. The inclusion of a database system allows doctors to keep a detailed and organized record of their patients' medical history and treatment plans. This can be particularly useful for patients who have chronic conditions that require ongoing management, as it enables doctors to track progress over time and adjust treatment plans as necessary.
3. The ability for patients to upload images of their medical files can make it easier for doctors to access important information that may have been recorded by other healthcare providers. This can help to ensure that patients receive more comprehensive and coordinated care.

Overall, the prescription form and database system in your web application can streamline the process of providing care to patients, improve communication between healthcare providers, and ultimately result in better health outcomes for patients.
